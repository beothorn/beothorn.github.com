<p>If you are having issues with tilesets, like this:</p>
<img src="/assets/img/godot/lines_between_tiles.png"/>
<p>You may want to disable Filter and Mipmaps for your textures</p>
<p>To do that select your texture on the FileSystem view and the Import tab on the upper left part of the screen.</p>
<img src="/assets/img/godot/Select_import.png"/>
<p>Then disable Filter and Mipmaps and <strong>reimport</strong>. To me for some reason it was already disabled, 
    enabling reimporting then disabling and reimporting did the trick </p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
