title: Buffer overflow on x86_64 tutorial

<p>On this post I will use gdb to show how the stack works, what happens 
    when you do a function call and how a user can exploit an unchecked buffer
    to overwrite the stack.</p>
<p>This tutorial assumes you are using a x86_64 linux pc.</p>

<h2>Understanding the stack</h2>

<p>The stack is a reserved space in memory where the executable stores local variables, function
    parameters and the return address for the function caller. 
</p>
<p>The top of the stack moves in decrements. It is like the opposite of an array.</p>
<p>On a typical x86_64 architecture executable, the top of the stack is stored on the rsp register (Stack Pointer)
    and the base of the stack is stored on the rbp register (Base Pointer).
</p>
<p>We also have the rip (Instruction Pointer), a register that contains the address 
    of the current instruction being executed.
</p>
<p>
    Usually a function will only read and write on the stack inside the range from rsp to rbp 
    (remember that rsp is always smaller than rbp because the stack top is decremented).
</p>
<p>But this is not necessarilly true. You can compile c code in a way no checks
    will be done for stack access. In practice there are protections for this both by 
    the compiler and by the OS that we will need to disable for our example to work.
</p>
<p>Let's use <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/">gdb</a> to see what goes on when a function is called.</p>
<p>
    Start by copying this code:
</p>
<pre>
int c(short n){
        return n + 1;
}

int b(){
        short n = 42;
        return c(n);
}

int a(){
        return b();
}

int main(){
        a();
}
</pre>
<p>Save it as main.c and then just compile it:</p>
<pre>gcc main.c -o main</pre>
<p>Let's start debugging it with gdb:</p>
<pre>gdb main</pre>
<p>To run the executable and stop at the first instruction type start:</p>
<pre>
(gdb) start
Temporary breakpoint 1 at 0x117b
Starting program: /home/carol/dev/backToBasics/understandingTheStack/main 

Temporary breakpoint 1, 0x000055555555517b in main ()
</pre>
<p>First, let's check the instructions for the main function using dissasemble:</p>
<pre>
(gdb) disassemble main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
    0x0000555555555173 <+0>:	endbr64 
    0x0000555555555177 <+4>:	push   %rbp
    0x0000555555555178 <+5>:	mov    %rsp,%rbp

    0x000055555555518a <+23>:	pop    %rbp
    0x000055555555518b <+24>:	ret    
End of assembler dump.
</pre>
<p>The instructions are executed left to right, so:</p>
<pre>mov    $0x0,%eax</pre>
<p>is copying 0 to the register eax.</p>
<p>Gdb conveniently adds an arrow on the instruction currently on the rip register (Instruction Pointer)</p>
<p>We can see that on instruction +4 the value from the rbp (Base Pointer) 
    is being pushed on the stack. This causes the rsp (Stack Pointer) to be incremented.</p>
<p>Then on +5 the current value for the Stack Pointer is being copied to the Base Pointer</p>
<p>All stack operations will be done from the Base Pointer address downwards.</p>
<pre>
    0x0000555555555178 <+5>:	mov    %rsp,%rbp
</pre>
<p>We can inspect the values inside those two registers using the 
    <a href="https://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/x">x command</a></p>
<pre>
(gdb) x $rbp
0x7fffffffdf10:	0x00000000
(gdb) x $rsp
0x7fffffffdf10:	0x00000000
</pre>
<p>There is nothing interesting going on right now here. Both registers have the same value
    pointing to the same memory address 0x7fffffffdf10. 
</p>
<p>
    We can move on to the next instruction:
</p>

</pre>
<p>Finnaly things are going to start getting interesting. 
    We are going to call our first function a().</p>
<p>Take note that the instruction right after call on +18 has an address of 0x0000555555555185.</p>
<p>By the way, disas is an alias to disassemble. ni is an alias to nexti and 
    si is an alias to stepi.</p>
<p>The difference between nexti and stepi is that stepi goes inside the call being made.</p>
<p>That's what we want right now so let's step into the next instruction.</p>
<pre>

End of assembler dump.    
</pre>
<p>The first thing we see is that we are now inside the instructions for function a</p>
<p>See how on instructions +5 and +8 we do exactly the same thing we did on our main?</p>
<p>That's because, by convention, it is the responsability of the called function to restore the Base Pointer
    and keep track of the Stack Pointer. So, here the function keeps the Base Pointer for the 
    stack inside the stack itself.
</p>
<p>But before the content of the rbp register is pushed on the stack, 
    let's take a look inside the Stack Pointer and the Base Pointer value.</p>
<pre>
(gdb) x $rbp
0x7fffffffdf10:	0x00000000
(gdb) x $rsp
0x7fffffffdf08:	0x55555185
</pre>
<p>The rsp value has changed from 0x7fffffffdf10 to 0x7fffffffdf08</p>
<p>That means the stack range from base to stack pointer has size:</p>
<pre>0x7fffffffdf10 - 0x7fffffffdf08 = 8 bits</pre>
<p>We can use the command x/2x $rsp to print the 2 bytes (8 bits) starting from rsp in hexadecimal.</p>
<p>We start from the rsp since the stack adresses grows in decrements.</p>
<pre>
(gdb) x/2x $rsp
0x7fffffffdf08:	0x55555185	0x00005555
</pre>
<p>We are on a system that uses 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little-endian</a> meaning we need to read the 
    byte from the bigger address first. This gives us: </p>
<pre>0x0000555555555185</pre>
<p>And if you look back again on the main function that is the address of the instruction right after
    the call for a().
</p>
<pre> 
   0x0000555555555185 <+18>:	mov    $0x0,%eax
</pre>
<p>We can conclude then that the call instruction moves the rip to the address of a(), adds the 
    return address to the stack and decrement the rsp so the stack contains the return address.
</p>
<p>The fact that the return address is stored inside the stack is what the 
    buffer overflow exploit takes advantage of. We can continue with the execution and come 
    back to this later.
</p>
<p>
    The function being called then updates the Base Pointer position so the return 
    address in the range of the stack
    the function will manipulate.
</p>
<p>We will add a breakpoint right before b() is called, continue the execution and then step 
    into b() and disassemble it:</p>

<p>There is something more being done with the Stack Pointer now</p>
<pre>
    0x0000555555555148 <+8>:	sub    $0x10,%rsp
</pre>
<p>At this instruction the Stack Pointer is being 
    moved down 0x10 bits, which converting to decimal is 16 bits or 4 bytes.</p>
<p>This is done because local variables are also stored on the stack, and this instruction is
    reserving space to be used by our variable:
</p>
<pre>short n = 42;</pre>
<p>A short has a size of 2 bytes but the rsp is moved 4 bytes. This is due the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment">data alignment</a>.</p> 
<p>At this instruction:</p>
<pre>
    0x000055555555514c <+12>:	movw   $0x2a,-0x2(%rbp)
</pre>
<p>The number 42 (0x2a in hexadecimal) is being copied to memory at the Base Pointer minus 2. 
</p>
<p>Then the value is copied from the stack at -0x2(%rbp) to the eax register</p>
<p>On +22, the value from the eax register is copied to the edi register.</p>
<p>As long as there are registers available, parameters are passed inside the registers.
    So, for c(short n), the value for n is inside the edi register. 
</p>
<p>If you want to see what happens when there are lots of parameters, 
    <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/eGqvzac73">see this example on godbolt.</a>
</p>
<p>
    Next, on instruction +24, we call c. 0x000055555555515d should be the call return address.

<p>We are now on our last function on the call hierarchy. 
    The first two instructions are the same as before.</p>
<p>Save the Base Pointer on the stack and copy the new Base Pointer to the Stack Pointer</p>
<p>Instruction +8 copies the parameter from edi to another register, eax.</p>
<p>We are dealing with a short value (short has 2 bytes) and the register 
    eax has size 16 bits (4 bytes)  </p>
<p>The least significant 2 bytes of EAX can be treated as a 16-bit register called AX.</p>
<p>At +10 it copies the value of AX to the stack. At +14 it copies 
    it again to eax and at +18 it adds 1 to eax</p>
<p>The eax register holds the value returned from the function.</p>
<p>Let's put a breakpoint at +21 and look at the stack starting from the rsp until 0x7fffffffdf10,
    which was the address for the Base Pointer on main()</p>

0x00007fffffffdf10 -> The Base Pointer address at main()

0x00007fffffffdf00 -> The Base Pointer address at a()
0x002a -> The local variable at b() with value 42. It occupies only 2 bytes 
0x555555555190 -> Whatever was on the stack before we stored 42, 
                  we only care about the least significant 2 bytes, 
                  so this is ignored
0x00000000 -> padding, also ignored
0x00000000 -> padding, also ignored
0x000055555555515d -> The return address on b()
0x00007fffffffdef0  -> The Base Pointer address at b()
</pre>
<p>Now that we got to the last instructions on the call hierarchy, we can run two more instructions.</p>
<p>Instruction +21 should revert the stack Base Pointer to the one stored at the beginning of the function.</p>
<p>pop will copy the value on top of the stack to rbp. Since the stack wasn't used for anything, it contains
    the value for the original Base Pointer.
</p>
<p>Instruction +22 should use the address at the top of the stack 
    as the next insturction on the rip (Instructon Pointer)</p>
<p>
    ret is equivalent to: pop register; jmp register;

<p>And then return will do the same as it did on c()</p>
<p>The most important thing to notice was that the stack holds both local variables data and 
    the return adresses from function calls.
</p>
<p>With this general idea on how the stack works, 
    what goes inside it and how it is used to jump back and forth 
    instructions we can go on to another example.</p>

<h2>Rewriting the stack using Buffer Overflow</h2>

<p>For this example to easily work we will need to turn off some OS protections.</p>
<p>Don't worry, we will do it in a way that is only temporary. First we need to force the OS
    to stop randomizing the virtual address so we can reliably reference an address. If Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
     is on (default) the adressess will be different on each execution.
</p>
<pre>
sudo -i
echo "0" > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
echo This should print 0
cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
</pre>
<p>We will also need to compile with gcc using the flag -fno-stack-protector</p>
<p>This is the code we are going to exploit:</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void unrelated(){
    printf("This should not be called\n");
}

void enterString(){
    char buffer[2];
    printf("Enter two characters:\n");
    scanf("%s", buffer); 
}

int main(){
    enterString();
}
</pre>
<p>
    It is not doing anything usefull. It asks for two characters, write them into a buffer array
    and then do noting with it. There is also a function that is not called. For simplicity sake
    we will exploit the buffer overflow to call that function. Another thing that can also be done
    is writing a function to be called on the stack itself. This would require a little more work
    and
