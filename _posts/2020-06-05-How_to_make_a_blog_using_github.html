title: How to make a blog using github
layout: singlePost

<p>
    You probably have already seen some software page hosted from github itself. 
    This is a nice feature offered by github called <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> that
    basically allow you to host static content and serve it as a regular website.
</p>
<p>
    But that's not all of it. Github pages also has support for <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static 
    web site generator.
</p>
<p>
    Blogger and other platforms give you many tools, but they add an overhead if you want to do anything more advanced than text.
</p>
<p>
    Using Jekyll and github pages, each post is a raw html file, and besides that 
    you get a blog that is easy to backup and move elsewhere, if you must.
</p>
<p>
    I tried to create the simplest possible theme for a blog (this one you are reading) and I will 
    walk you through on how to reuse it for yourself.
</p>

<h3>What you will need</h3>
<p>
    Some knowledge of git and html or markdown. I intend to maybe in the future write an app to commit the post 
    files so even this is not required but I digress.
</p>
<h3>Forking the repo</h3>
<p>First step is to fork this repo. But instead of using the fork function on github, 
    we will clone the repo and re-commit it.</p>
<p>This way you can do it as many times as we want for the same repository</p>
<p>You need to have a repository, so for our example let's create YOUR_BLOG</p>
<p>You can also create a repo YOUR_USER.github.com which will result in a sligthly different url.</p>
<p>On your commandline do:</p>
<p>git clone git@github.com:beothorn/SimpleGithubBlog.git</p>
<p>mv SimpleGithubBlog YOUR_BLOG</p>
<p>cd YOUR_BLOG</p>
<p>git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USER/YOUR_BLOG.git</p>
<p>git push</p>
<p>Now you need to enable github pages on the master branch. On your repository go to Settings>Github Pages</p>
<p>Now on Source choose Master</p>
<img src="/assets/img/blogTutorial/enableGithubPages.png"/>
<p>Now access http://YOUR_USER.github.io/YOUR_BLOG , or if you used your own name just http://YOUR_USER.github.io/</p>
<p>You should already see your blog.</p>

<h3>Changing the blogs name</h3>

<p>Now let's change the title of this blog to yours.</p>
<p>Open _config.yml you should see:</p>
<pre>
name: YOUR_BLOG
description: Your blog with interesting articles
url: http://YOUR_USER.github.io/YOUR_BLOG
</pre>
<p>name will be the title displayed on the header</p>
<p>description and url will be used to fill the rss feed at http://YOUR_USER.github.io/YOUR_BLOG/feed.xml</p>

<h3>Changing the color theme, header and footer</h3>
<p>Open styles.css at the project root folder, you should see the color values that you can customize as you wish:</p>
<pre>
:root {
    --text-color: #bfbfbf;
    --lighter-text-color: #919191;
    --background-color: #1c1c1c;
    --post-background-color: #444;
    --link-color: #5992b5;
}
</pre>
<p>The header and footer are under the _includes folder</p>

<h3>Adding and removing posts</h3>

<p>With Jekyll, each post is a file under the _posts folder. Posts can be markdown or html.</p>
<p>The file must have the format Year-Month-Day-PostTitle.md for markdown Year-Month-Day-PostTitle.html for HTML.</p>
<p>There is already two example posts there, opening any of them you will see that before the actual post you have:</p>
<pre>
---
title: A Koch Island written in javascript
layout: singlePost
comments: true
---
</pre>
<p>This section is the Jekyll "Front Matter" and is required. This is a snippet of YAML and is used to set some variables</p>
<p>First one is the title of the post, it shows on the left menu and also on the rss feed</p>
<p>Second is the layout, you can check the layouts under the _layouts folder. Just keep it like that</p>
<p>For last "comments" tells wether or not <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> comments should be enabled for this post</p>
<p><a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> comments can be configured selecting 
    <a href="https://disqus.com/profile/signup/intent/">"I want to install Disqus on my site" here</a></p>
<p>You can also enable or disable it per post, just set the variable to false</p>
<p>After that, you can write your post with the language you have chosen. 
    Then just commit it and github will process and publish your blog.</p>
