<p>
Java agents are regular java code that can be included when running any java application
</p>
<p>
Java agents are special because they are given access to the Instrumentation API, which allows them to change bytecode.
</p>
<h2>Why would you want it?</h2>
<p>
When working inside your codebase, you have total freedom. If you need to extend any logic you have many options, such as composition, 
inheritance, annotation processing at runtime and many other possible solutions. A solution using a Java agent (or any change at bytecode level) is 
not what you want in this case. 
</p>
<p>
When you need to extend functionality in a library, things start getting a little harder. Sure, library developers plan how to make 
them open to extension, but it is a fact of life that it is not possible to foresee every possible requirement.
</p>
<p>
Still, there are ways to work with it without writing a java agent. You should use the language features as intended. If not 
possible you can shadow classes to override behaviour. Another possibility is using a custom classloader that changes bytecode at runtime. 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, you may want extend functionality in third party code. There may be many reasons for that, such as meta analysis, security features 
or anything that needs to be implemented in a totally separate binary.
</p>
<p>
So, in summary, you want an agent when you want to do runtime analysis of an application or if you need total separation 
between the regular app and some functionality that changes the bytecode.
</p>
<h2>Bytecode manipulation?</h2>
<p>
The JVM is an application that interprets a set of operations and a bunch of metadata encoded in a class.
</p>
<p>
Usually, these classes are distributed in files with a .class extension. These classes can then distributed inside a zip file, commonly
with the .jar extension. Inside this jar, a text file, the Manifest, points to a class file implementing a main function. 
</p>
<p>
You can then just use the java executable to run these JAR files using the -jar argument, such as:"
<p><pre>java -jar myApp.jar</pre></p>
</p>
<p>
The format of these class files, the bytecode, is described in the java documentation <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html">here</a>
</p>
<p>
Knowing the bytecode format, it becomes possible to modify it. You could open it with a hexeditor, for example, and change the code behaviour.
</p>
<p>
Let`s try an example. This is a simple java code that checks a key and executes some code if the key is correct.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if ("secretpass".equals(args[0])) {
            System.out.println("Access granted");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access DENIED");
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>Which we can compile and run:</p>
<p>
<pre>
javac Test.java
java -cp . Test "wrong" # outputs Access DENIED
java -cp . Test "secretpass" # outputs Access granted
</pre></p>
<p>Fortunately, openjdk ships with a disassembler, javap.</p>
<p>If we use it on Test.class we can see what instructions are being used on it.</p>
<p><pre>
    javap -v Test.class 

    ...Some stuff
      public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
        descriptor: ([Ljava/lang/String;)V
        flags: (0x0009) ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC
        Code:
          stack=3, locals=1, args_size=1
             0: ldc           #7                  // String secretpass
             2: aload_0
             3: iconst_0
             4: aaload
             5: invokevirtual #9                  // Method java/lang/String.equals:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z
             8: ifeq          22
            11: getstatic     #15                 // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
            14: ldc           #21                 // String Access granted
            16: invokevirtual #23                 // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
            19: goto          30
            22: getstatic     #15                 // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
            25: ldc           #29                 // String Access DENIED
            27: invokevirtual #23                 // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
            30: return
          LineNumberTable:
            line 3: 0
            line 4: 11
            line 6: 22
            line 8: 30
          StackMapTable: number_of_entries = 2
            frame_type = 22 /* same */
            frame_type = 7 /* same */
    }
    SourceFile: "Test.java"    
</pre></p>
<p>The important instruction here is the ifeq. From the  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html">documentation</a></p>
<p>"An ifeq instruction is type safe iff one can validly pop a type matching int off the incoming operand stack yielding the outgoing type state 
NextStackFrame, and the operand of the instruction, Target, is a valid branch target assuming an incoming type state of NextStackFrame."</p>
<p>The other important instruction we need is ifne (if not equals).</p>
<p>From <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-7.html">here</a> we can see that ifeq opcode is 0x99 and ifne opcode is 0x9a.</p>
<p>Using an hex editor we can then just change ifeq to ifne:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/javaAgent1/before.png"/></p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/javaAgent1/after.png"/></p>
<p>And now if we run Test with the incorrect key after modifying the bytecode, we get:</p>
<p><pre>
java -cp . Test "wrong"
Access granted
</pre></p>
<h2>Changing the bytecode at runtime</h2>
<p>And this leads us back to what actually is a java agent. A java agent is a class that implements a premain function.</p>
<p>The premain function gets an argument Instrumetation which allows the agent to get the bytecode as a byte array and change it.</p>
<p>All you need is a jar file with a manifest pointing to the class containing the premain</p>
<p>The agent code that does the same thing we did manually would look like this:</p>
<p><pre>
public class Agent {

    public static void premain(
        String agentArgs,
        Instrumentation instrumentation
    ){
        instrumentation.addTransformer(new ClassFileTransformer() {
            @Override
            public byte[] transform(
                    ClassLoader loader,
                    String className,
                    Class<?> classBeingRedefined,
                    ProtectionDomain protectionDomain,
                    byte[] classFile
            ) {
                byte[] newBytecode = new byte[classFile.length];
                if (className.contains("Test")) {
                    for (int i = 0; i < classFile.length; i++) {
                        if (i == 0x1f5) {
                            newBytecode[i] = (byte) 0x9A;
                        } else {
                            newBytecode[i] = classFile[i];
                        }
                    }
                    return newBytecode;
                }
                return null;
            }
        });
    }
}
</pre></p>
<p>The manifest should look like this:</p>
<p><pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Premain-Class: com.github.beothorn.Agent
</pre></p>
<p>And to execute it, you just need to pass the javaagent argument</p>
<p><pre>
java -javaagent:./agent.jar -cp . Test "wrong"
Access granted    
</pre></p>
<p>Here you can see an example of <href a="https://github.com/beothorn/JavaAgentDisassembler">an example of an agent that partially disassembles classes</href></p>
<h2>Doing it in real life</h2>
<p>This is just an example to give the general idea of what an agent does. In real life it would be a lot of work to interpret and rewrite bytecode like this.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use a library that does the bytecode transformation for you.</p>
<p>You can choose ASM if you want low level bytecode manipulation. If you prefer something that is easier to use and mostly protects you from going into 
instruction level, a great option is using <a href="https://bytebuddy.net">bytebuddy</a>.
</p>
<p>In upcoming blog entries, I will provide examples of how to use Byte Buddy for different tasks.</p>
<p>I will also show how it was used to create <a href="">Javaflame</a> and maybe if you really need to build your own agent 
    or Javaflame already solver the issue.</p>
